title: The road to becoming a software engineer

Steve Jobs once said:

"You can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well worn path."

I was an auditor and analyst in the past life. By that you can probably already tell why this quote resonates to me. I'm not sure what the future might hold. But in this moment, this is exactly what I want.
