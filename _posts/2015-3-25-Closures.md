title: Closures
---

As a Software Engineer, you must understand this concept.

Simply put, a closure happens when an inner scope is created relative to an outer scope, where the inner scope retains access to variables outside its own scope. Allow me to elaborate:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Closures.png)

Hope this helps your understanding of closures! In case you didn't notice, all the code I'll be showing is in the context of JavaScript, unless otherwise stated.

Speaking of sushi... that makes me hungry. Thanks for reading!
