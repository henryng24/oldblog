April Fools!

With all the April Fools content surfacing across each corner of the web, I figured I'd jump on the bandwaggon. Count on Google to always do something with Google Maps!

Now for our real topic of discussion today: the Call and Apply methods in JavaScript. Although they are extremely useful, I personally found it a little difficult to grasp conceptually.

Assuming you know how the keyword 'this' is used in JavaScript (and if you're reading this, you should), Call and Apply lend themselves immensely to borrowing functions and setting the 'this' value in function invocations. I will show you examples below that show these two respective scenarios. Though they may not include the 'this' keyword, in instances where it's required, 'this' can just be passed in as the first argument in Call or Apply.
